# Markov-Chains_N-grams
I have attempted to implement a creative text generation system that uses the 
Markov process and N-Grams techniques to generate short stories.
The system will compose a prose with short paragraph based on the work of a well-known author. 
The most obvious method is to examine the novel to see how the words flow together. Then, given the 
N previous words, it would determine a likely 'new' word to follow.
