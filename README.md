# Markov-Chains_N-grams

Markov chains have proven to be extremely useful in the development of the majority of AI text generators. Inspired by this creation, I attempted to implement a creative text generation system that generates short stories using the Markov process and N-Grams techniques. Based on the work of a well-known author, the system will compose a prose with short paragraphs. The most obvious approach is to read the novel and observe how the words flow together. Then, given the N preceding words, it would predict a likely 'new' word to come next.
